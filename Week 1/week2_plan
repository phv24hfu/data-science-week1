WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Daniel Salmon]
Date: [05/02/2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (String-linked changes)
-------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
Tutorial 1
Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
Collector
Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
So that the percentages recorded by each collector is correct.
What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
Chaning Similar names into one main name. So when searched only the one main name appears.


ISSUE 2 (Changes in variable syntax)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [What's the problem? 1 sentence]
Many data inputs are NA
Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial name/number]
Tutorial 3
Which variable(s) affected: [Variable name(s)]
body_mass_mg, collector, eggs_laid, eggs_hatched
Why this is important to fix: [Biological/analytical reason]
So that there is no bias in the results, and no errors are produced from non-numerical data being present
What I plan to do: [The technique I'll use, in plain English]
Create a flag to not include the NA values but stull include the rest of the data for the specific mosquito ID


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Mosquito id is not numbered in order - decided to leave as-is because it has no impact on the overal testing]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Why have some mosquitoes hatched more eggs then they laid?

2. What was the need for the treatments?
